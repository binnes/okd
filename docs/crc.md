You can fetch crc binaries without Red Hat subscription [here](https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/rest/mirror2/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/latest/)

```shell
$ crc config set preset okd
Changes to configuration property 'preset' are only applied when the CRC instance is created.
If you already have a running CRC instance with different preset, then for this configuration change to take effect, delete the CRC instance with 'crc delete', setup it with `crc setup` and start it with 'crc start'.

$ crc config view
- consent-telemetry                     : yes
- preset                                : okd
```
